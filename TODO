* rework configglue to read the configuration more like optparse, with
   a --dump option to produce the ini-style config file

HOWTO do a release:

 * edit setup.py and set the correct version number
 * verify that setup.py sdist generates a tarball and you are completely confident
   that all the contents of the tarball are correct (any new files are there, etc.)
 * run python setup.py sdist register upload, you will be prompted to login to pypi
   and the new release is registered and uploaded.
 * To also upload to launchpad:
   - manage-credentials create -c ubuntu-dev-tools -l 2 (only if you don't have this already)
   - lp-project-upload configglue 0.9pre1 configglue-0.9pre1.tar.gz (substituting correct versions)
 * Prepare a new ubuntu package from the tarball.
